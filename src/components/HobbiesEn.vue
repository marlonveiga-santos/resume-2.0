                <p>I have few hobbies, but as this information is always requested, then there are some activities that help me pass the time:</p>
                <p>Games: I like games (as well as any human being today), but I have a preference for emulation of old games. Not out of nostalgia, but to observe how so many creative ideas (and others not so much) were developed in equipment so limited.</p>
                <p>Karaoke: I sing a lot, but I sing badly! (hahahaha). If anyone who sings evils awe, then I must be on a good path. But I do not go around singing softly, just in moments of relaxation.</p>
                <p>Reading: I have always had the habit of reading a lot. I have as a preference, reading books on psychology and philosophy, although I read some fiction books and comic books (yeah, that's good!) <br> If you have any good books to recommend to me, feel free to do it.</p>
                <p>Travel: Just on my mind! But if that reality changes, it will be updated here!</p>
                <p>Studying: Although I'm not a bastion of knowledge, I know from my own reality that study can change a person's reality, and I can always try to learn more about various many subjects, especially those related to the universe of technology.</p><br>
